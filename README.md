## Getting Started

To start using Alipp, follow these simple steps:

1. Install the Alipp compiler by running the following command:

    ```
    TOWRITE
    ```

2. Create a new Alipp file with the `.alip` extension.

3. Write your Alipp code using the familiar JavaScript syntax, but with Kyrgyz keywords and variable names.

4. Compile your Alipp code to JavaScript by running the following command:

    ```
    TOWRITE
    ```

5. Use the generated JavaScript file in your projects, just like any other JavaScript file.

## Example

Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program written in Alipp:

```kyrgyz
көрсөтүү("Салам, Дүйнө!");
```

When compiled to JavaScript, it becomes:

```javascript
console.log("Салам, Дүйнө!");
```
